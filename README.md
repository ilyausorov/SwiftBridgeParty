# SwiftBridgeParty

Prepared with ❤️ for the React Native NYC Meetup on Nov 12, 2019.

Thanks to [@bpolonia]( https://github.com/bpolonia ) for organizing and [@majorleaguesoccer]( https://github.com/majorleaguesoccer ) for hosting!

This app was bootstrapped via react-native init and uses **react-native 0.61.4**.

To run the app: 
1. clone the repo to your machine, 
2. install node_modules and Pods (cd ios + pod install)
3. turn on Metro bundler with npm/yarn start 
4. and then do react-native run-ios (or open up XCode and Run the app from there)

###### P.S. Please don't sue me.
