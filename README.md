# SwiftBridgeParty

Prepared with ❤️ for the React Native NYC Meetup on Nov 12, 2019. 
My talk was called **Bridging a Native Module Doesn’t Have To Be Scary: Swift Edition**.

Thanks to [@bpolonia]( https://github.com/bpolonia ) for organizing and [@majorleaguesoccer]( https://github.com/majorleaguesoccer ) for hosting!

This app was bootstrapped via react-native init and uses **react-native 0.61.4**. iOS only (because we're here for Swift).

The following native repos were used in the creation of this app:
1. [GradientView]( https://github.com/soffes/GradientView )
2. [ScrollableGraphView]( https://github.com/philackm/ScrollableGraphView )
3. [InputBarAccessoryView]( https://github.com/nathantannar4/InputBarAccessoryView )
4. [CameraBackground]( https://github.com/yonat/CameraBackground ) (won't work if running on simulator)

To run the app: 
1. clone the repo to your machine, 
2. install node_modules and Pods (cd ios + pod install)
3. turn on Metro bundler with npm/yarn start 
4. open up XCode and Run the app from there either onto a simulator or your device.

###### P.S. Please don't sue me.
